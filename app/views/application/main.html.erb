<h4>This is a great tool for teachers who assign group activities. Here is what to expect inside:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Enter your classes and fill your rosters. They will stay saved for later use.</li>
  <li>From class settings, you can select entirely random or random, gender-mixed groups. You can also create special "separation" cases for students that should not be grouped together.</li>
  <li>On the randomizer screen, you can generate any amount of groups for your class.</li>
  <li>Bonus - Students will not know about your random configurations. If Billy and Tommy do not work well together, but they really like to team up, they will not see that you have disabled this possibility under the hood.</li>
</ul>
